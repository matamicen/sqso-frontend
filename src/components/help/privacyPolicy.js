        <h2 dir="ltr">Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">
          This policy explains what information we collect when you use SuperQSO
          sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content
          (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;). It also has information about how we store,
          use, transfer, and delete that information. Our aim is not just to
          comply with privacy law. It&rsquo;s to earn your trust.
        </p>
        <h2 dir="ltr">Information We Collect &amp; How We Use It</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">
          The tracking we do at SuperQSO is to make our product work as well as
          possible. So, to give you the best possible experience in using
          SuperQSO, we collect information from your interactions with our
          Services. Some of this information, you actively tell us (such as your
          email address, which we use to track your account or communicate with
          you). Other information, we collect based on actions you take while
          using SuperQSO, such as what pages you view (including how much of a
          given page and for how long) and your use of product features (like
          follows, likes, QsoScans and QsoLinks). This information includes
          records of those interactions, your Internet Protocol address,
          information about your device (such as device or browser type), and
          referral information (how you got to a particular page).
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">We use this information to:</p>

        <h2 dir="ltr">Information Disclosure</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">
          SuperQSO won&rsquo;t transfer information about you to third parties
          for the purpose of providing or facilitating third-party advertising
          to you. We won&rsquo;t sell information about you to a third-party.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
          We may transfer your account information with third parties in some
          circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service
          provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) with
          academic or non-profit researchers, with aggregation, anonymization,
          or pseudonymization; (4) when we have a good faith belief it is
          required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal
          process; (5) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help
          prevent imminent harm to someone.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
          If we are going to share your information in response to legal
          process, we&rsquo;ll give you notice so you can challenge it (for
          example by seeking court intervention), unless we&rsquo;re prohibited
          by law or believe doing so may endanger others or cause illegal
          conduct. We will object to legal requests for information about users
          of our services that we believe are improper.
        </p>
        <h2 dir="ltr">Public Data</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">
          Search engines may index your SuperQSO user profile page, public
          interactions (such as photos, audios, likes or comments), and post
          pages (such as QSOs, Listen, Post and the audios &amp; photos), such
          that people may find these pages when searching against your name on
          services like Google, DuckDuckGo, or Bing. Users may also share links
          to your content on social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter.
          Information posted about you by other user who use our services may
          also be public. For example, other user may tag you in a photo or
          mention you in a Post (Qso, Listen or Post). Other user may take a
          picture of you or record your voice from the radio during the QSO and
          post that audio in SuperQSO.
        </p>
        <h2 dir="ltr">Data Storage</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">
          SuperQSO uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as
          Amazon, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
          technology we need to run SuperQSO. We maintain two types of logs :
          server logs and event logs. By using the Services, you authorize
          SuperQSO to transfer, store, and use your information in United
          States, and any other country where we operate.
        </p>
        <h2 dir="ltr">Third-Party Embeds</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">
          Some of the content that you see displayed on SuperQSO is not hosted
          by SuperQSO. These &ldquo;embeds&rdquo; are hosted by a third-party
          and embedded in a SuperQSO page, so that it appears to be part of that
          page. For example: YouTube or Vimeo videos, Imgur or Giphy gifs,
          SoundCloud audio files, Twitter tweets, GitHub code snippets, or
          Scribd documents that appear within a SuperQSO post. These files send
          data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site
          directly (for example, when you load a SuperQSO post page with a
          YouTube video embedded in it, that video appears because of a pointer
          to files hosted by YouTube, and in turn YouTube receives data about
          your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you
          watch).
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
          SuperQSO doesn&rsquo;t control what data third parties collect in
          cases like this, or what they ultimately do with it. So, third-party
          embeds on SuperQSO are not covered by this Privacy Policy. They are
          covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service (so, when you
          watch a YouTube video embedded in a SuperQSO post, the use of data
          about your interactions with the video would be covered by
          YouTube&rsquo;s privacy policy).
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
          Some embeds may ask you for personal information, such as submitting
          your email address, through a form linked to from a SuperQSO post. We
          do our best to keep bad actors off of SuperQSO. However, if you choose
          to submit your information to a third party this way, we don&rsquo;t
          know what they may do with it. As explained above, their actions are
          not covered by this Privacy Policy. So, please be careful when you see
          embedded forms on SuperQSO asking for your email address or any other
          personal information. Make sure you understand who you are submitting
          your information to and what they say they plan to do with it. We
          suggest that you do not submit your email address or other personal
          information to any third-party through an embedded form.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
          When posting on SuperQSO, you may not embed a form that allows
          submission of personal information by users. You must link offsite to
          a page that allows such submissions by users, and that page&rsquo;s
          appearance must be distinct enough from SuperQSO to ensure it does not
          cause confusion among users over to whom they are submitting personal
          information. Failure to do so may lead SuperQSO to disable the post or
          take other action to limit or disable your account.
        </p>
        <h2 dir="ltr">Tracking &amp; Cookies</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">
          We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when
          you return to our Services. We use them in various ways, for example
          to log you in, remember your preferences (such as default language),
          evaluate email effectiveness, allow our paywall and meter to function,
          and personalize content and other services. Without cookies, our
          metered paywall would not work, so they are necessary to
          SuperQSO&rsquo;s basic functionality.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
          SuperQSO saves data about the URLs you Save to SuperQSO , but we do
          not otherwise track your visits or activities off SuperQSO Services.
          We track your interactions within the SuperQSO Services (which
          encompasses SuperQSO.com, custom domains hosted by SuperQSO, and your

          several weeks). But, if you delete your account, your information and
          content will be unrecoverable after that time. SuperQSO may preserve
